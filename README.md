# PyroFuzz - 2D Game Design Project

This repository contains my first project in game programming class. It is a top-down 2D game created in the Godot game engine.

A playable version for Windows is available on the [Releases page](https://github.com/cameronbaum0124/game_programming_2D_design/releases)

## About the Project

I collaborated with four other people to create this game and acted as the **project lead**.
- Creating **all in-game art assets** (except for the three enemies)
- Participating in gameplay and functionality programming
- Managing task distribution, group meetings, and the short development time

## How to Play

- Left mouse click to shoot
- WASD to move
- Pick up charcoal to level up
- Pick up gasoline cans to gain faster fire rate for a limited time

<sub>Note: some aspects of the game are either incomplete or finicky due to time constraints and it being our first project. If you encounter any problems, close and restart!</sub>
